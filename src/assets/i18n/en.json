    "TextBody1": "In Portugal has been an accentuated growth in the search for tourist spaces of the most varied types (like rural and oenological) thanks to our country richness.",
    "TextBody2": "Therefore, it is time to give the due relevance to our geological patrimony that is so diversified. And it is that our main objective, to show in an accessible way the most varied geological places that in most times has such captive and surrounding sights.",
    "TextBody3": "Tourists that search for more knowledge across the museums also have not been forgotten, once our architecture also makes the use of the most varied types of rock, just be more attentive (or have our application).",
    "TextBody4": "At last our project also is adequate for students of geology, once we will contemplate in our routes the most varied concepts that are taught in that course.",
    "TextBody5": "We want that this application be the most interactive possible, therefore we want to put Portugal in movement and being little researchers (as far as possible at this point) of our geological patrimony. Our application will provide routes that the user can choose to investigate the most varied types of rock in nature. It wasn’t very appealing? We explain better, the idea is to investigate in the field and with that still gain some extras in the application. And the ones who doesn’t like to investigate in the nature? That’s a good question, of course we will also give the opportunity to choose a route were instead of contemplating the nature can pass by some touristic buildings, like churches, museums, the most easy to visualize will be those with an older architecture, where sometimes beyond the identification of the rock we can identify some fossils.",
    "TextBody6": "In short in our application registered users will be able to create routes, as well as having a profile page where you will be able to consult all the achievements.",
